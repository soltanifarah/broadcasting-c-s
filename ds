The task is to implement a distributed algorithm using threads in a client-server architecture.
The application consists of a server with a supervisor thread and multiple clients with controller and application threads.
The supervisor thread monitors the application execution, receives copies of exchanged messages and entity state information,
and displays the number of messages exchanged, ideal elapsed time, and real time.
The controller threads implement the distributed algorithm and communicate with the supervisor thread by sending copies of messages and data state information.
The application threads display the controller thread activity. The network topology for the algorithm can be a tree, ring, or complete graph,
and is represented by an array of neighbors for each controller thread
